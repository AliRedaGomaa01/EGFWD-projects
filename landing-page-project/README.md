# Landing Page Project

* Info

    * In this "landing-page" project I manipulated the page html source from this url "https://github.com/udacity/fend/blob/refresh-2019/projects/landing-page" 
        programmatically using JS code without any direct changes on HTML & CSS files except adding <script src=""></script> node to html file. 

    * I followed these steps in my code :

        // **** first of all adding <script src=""></script> node to html-file code 

        // **** making an internal-css style-node 

        // **** defining some global variables that used several times in the code 

        // **** adding more sections 
        
        // **** Building the nav & linking each item to its section then adding "menu__link" class to each nav item to get styles applied on it

        // **** Adding "active" & "active-tag" classes &  their styles to acive section "section that is near top of viewport" & its tag

        // **** Displaying nav-bar when scrolling & hiding it after 2 seconds of no scrolling on screens with min-width of 770 px 

        // **** Making a to-Top-Button & scroll to anchor ID using scrollTO event 

        // **** building NavMenuButton on screens with max-width of 770 px
